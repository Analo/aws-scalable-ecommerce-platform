# AWS Scalable E-Commerce Platform

> A **production-ready multi-tier e-commerce platform** built on AWS with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **comprehensive monitoring**.  
> Designed as a **portfolio project** to demonstrate **Cloud Engineering & DevOps skills** step-by-step — from repository setup to a fully scalable deployment.

##  Project Overview

This project simulates how a **Cloud Engineer / DevOps Engineer** would design, provision, and manage a **real-world multi-tier web application** on AWS.

The stack includes:

- **Networking (VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, Gateways)**
- **Security (IAM, Security Groups, NACLs)**
- **Compute (EC2 Auto Scaling, Load Balancer)**
- **Database (Amazon RDS for MySQL/Postgres)**
- **Storage & CDN (S3, CloudFront)**
- **Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, Alarms, Metrics)**
- **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions with Terraform workflows)**
- **Testing, Security Scans & Quality Gates**
